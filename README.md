#Best_Fit_Employee_Evaluation

Analytics project to predict an Employee's Tenure with the given employee. 
This project was done under its more fanciful name "Hire For the Long Haul" for the "Hands on with Business Analytics" class during my Masters.  

# Hire-for-a-long-Haul-Analytics-Project
In this project we make an effort to provide solutions that would analytically help the employer identify potentially ‘best fit’ candidates, not just for their skill set and the requirements of the position but also for the expected longevity from the employee. We considered hiring factors which could lower the attrition rate of the organization. We would like to form the employee fitness score by considering various measures of the employee such as Experience, Degrees obtained, Schools attended, the employee’s current employer’s ratings such as culture, compensation, work-life balance and other ratings and various measures of the employer such as the history and characteristics of similar past employees in the same position. We also considered employee movement patterns to get an understanding of how employees switch companies and how this could potentially help improve the organization’s retention measures.
